                    I am specializing in creation of web applications, back-end programming and front-end development.
                    My experience includes the usage of Java (Spring, JSP), Javascript (Jquery, Ajax), PHP/MySQL and .NET.
                    I take care of the front-end construction (html/javascript interface) as well as the backend programming (business model and database interaction).

                    Technologies I like to use are listed below but I am always looking to learn new ones.

                    - J2EE (Spring, JSP)
                    - PHP/MySQL
                    - Javascript (Jquery, Ajax)
                    - Databases: MySQL, SQL Server
